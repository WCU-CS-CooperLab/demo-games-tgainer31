In this game, two players control their respective spaceships, navigating through space and battling incoming asteroids and enemy ships.
The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible by avoiding collisions and taking down enemy targets. Each player has a limited number
of lives and a shield to protect them from damage.

How to Play the Game:
Controls for Player 1:
Thrust: (W)
Rotate Left (A), Rotate Right (D)
Shoot: Spacebar

Controls for Player 2:
Thrust: (Arrow Key Up)
Rotate Left (Arrow Key Left), Rotate Right (Arrow Key Right)
Shoot: Shift


    The players must avoid asteroids and enemy projectiles while trying to destroy enemies to progress through the levels.
Each player has a shield and a limited number of lives. If one of the players loses all their lives, the game ends.In Phase
I, only a single shield bar was shared between both players, which caused confusion during gameplay. In Phase II, each player
was given their own shield bar (Player 1 and Player 2). The shield bars are displayed at the top of the screen, and they 
change colors to indicate the shield's current status: green (high), yellow (medium), and red (low). When the shield is fully 
depleted, the player's health (lives) is affected. This change improves clarity for both players by allowing them to monitor 
their own shield status separately. This was essential for gameplay, as both players need to know when they are at risk without
having to interpret the shield status of the other player. Added Enemy AI to Target Closest Player, in Phase I, enemy ships only
targeted player 1. In Phase II, enemy AI was improved to target the nearest player automatically. The enemies now track the 
closest player and shoot projectiles in their direction. Added Collision Detection to Player 2's Ship. In Phase I, Player 2's ship
did not have proper collision detection, allowing it to pass through objects without taking damage. This issue was resolved in 
Phase II by adding proper collision detection for Player 2, making the game fair and consistent between both players. Adding 
collision detection for Player 2 fixed a major issue where Player 2 was at an unfair advantage due to the lack of collision response.
Now, both players face the same level of difficulty, and this made the game feel more balanced.Game Over Condition When Either Player
Dies. In Phase I, the game continued even after one player lost all their lives. In Phase II,the game now ends when either player loses
all their lives.

    During playtesting, I appreciated the addition of separate shield bars for each player. This made it much easier to track each player's
status. The color-changing bars provided immediate visual feedback, which helped me manage my shields more effectively as the game progressed.
I also noticed that the improved enemy AI added an extra challenge to the game. The AI now targets the nearest player, which made the 
gameplay feel more exciting. With that change you have to constantly move to avoid being hit by enemy fire, which made the experience more 
intense. Another important improvement was the addition of proper collision detection for Player 2. In Phase I, Player 2 was at an unfair 
advantage because there was no collision detection, so they could pass through objects without consequence. In Phase II, this issue was fixed,
and the game now feels much more balanced, as both players face the same level of difficulty.The change to the game over condition, where the 
game ends when either player dies, really enhanced the cooperative nature of the game. This raised the stakes becsause I feel as though both 
players now have to ensure each other's survival.knowing that one player's death ends the game makes the gameplay more fun, and it adds an 
extra layer of strategy and cooperation.
